# 👾 Space Invaders Game 👾

### 📌 Introduction

The Space Invaders arcade game is an iconic classic that has left an indelible mark on the world of video games. It introduced a new era of gaming experiences, becoming one of the earliest shooting games that captured the hearts and minds of players worldwide.

I created this game for my first project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

Let's take a trip down memory lane and challenge your shooting skills in the classic world of arcade games!

### 🏁 Getting Started

Check out the final version of my [Space Invaders Game](maviakazi.github.io/Space-Invaders/).

Follow the instructions below to save your planet from the cruel swarm of Alien Invaders:

-   Aim to shoot all the aliens before they reach bottom of the board to win the game.

-   If any alien reaches the bottom, the game gets over.

-   Use Right and Left Arrow Keys to move your spaceship and Arrow-Up key to shoot missiles.

### 📝 Wire Frame

A simple prototype of the game that I created before writing any code. My initial goal was to achieve the functionality and add styling after.

#### 📋 Game Board Visualisation

All the magic happens here on the board. It controls the movement of the aliens, player and the missiles. It contains a total of 225 squares divs (15 accross and 15 down).

Purple dots are the alien invaders and the green dot at the bottom row is the player.
